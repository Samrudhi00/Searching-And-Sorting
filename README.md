Linear Search Algorithm 
Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.
TC = O(n)  SC =(1) no requirement of additional memory

When to use Linear Search?
When we are dealing with a small dataset.
When you are searching for a dataset stored in contiguous memory.
